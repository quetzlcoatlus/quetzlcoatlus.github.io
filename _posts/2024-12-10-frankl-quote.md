> In other words, what matters is to make the best of any given situation... \[a view on human potential\] which at its best always allows for: (1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life\'s transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.
