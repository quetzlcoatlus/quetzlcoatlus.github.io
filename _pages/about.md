Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Ahoy there! My name is Alexander (Allie) Lane (they/them). Welcome to my personal website! This is where I'll be hosting my portfolio and blog content as my stake in the IndieWeb movement.

My professional goals include making a tangible impact in AI Safety, especially interpretability. Cognitive science and philosophy of intelligence is super cool.

I love video games and I love good stories. I love education and visualizations. I love solving puzzles and learning about the natural world. I hope this site inspires you ^^. There are dragons to slay and treasure to find!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
